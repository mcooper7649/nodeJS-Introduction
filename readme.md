### Node.js Introduction

## Backend Explained
---

1. Backend Developement Using JavaScript
    - Client-Side is Frontend Development
    - Server-Side and DB is Backend Developer

2. Backend development lets you hide your code or algoriths from the visitor, while frontend the code is handled client-side, allowing it to be inspected or replicate it. Your Api Keys would be exposed, etc.

2. The more code you have on the frontend, the longer the loading times, backend is optimal.

3. Backend Code from the Server will query our DB and return our application to the client-side(frontend). Again this structure vastly speeds up loading times and hide business logic.

## What is Node.js?

1. Java, Ruby on Rails, PHP, ASP.Net, Node.js, Python are all popular backend languages. We already know the Frontend language JavaScript and the js in Node.js is for Javascript because it understands js.

* WikiPedia, Uber, Twitter, Ebay, NetFlix, Trello are all popular sites that use Node.js 

2. What does it do?
    - Frontend limits what JS can do because it is limited to the assets of the browser, think local filesystem. 
    - Backend allows us to create not just web applications but desktop applications! Atom is popular Node.js app.
    - Node.js allows us to make queries on our page from the client-side and request information from our server, think a google search to googles db.

3. How to Run a BackEnd File?
    - node index.js   // is a common example of the terminal command to run node.

4. Node EPL?
    - When you install node you also install the NODE REPL
    - This allows you to interact with the live-server via command line
    - Just type "node" into terminal and you will be inside the REPL. This works basically the same way as the Chrome Console.
    - Type .exit to quit the REPL
